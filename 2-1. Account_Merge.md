## Additional Notes

- **Minimum Balance**: Ensure the destination account has sufficient balance to maintain the minimum required balance after receiving the transferred XLM.

## Troubleshooting
- **Transaction Failed**: If the transaction fails, double-check your transaction details and ensure all fields are correctly filled. If you need help, visit the Stellar Discord community or Stellar India TG for assistance.

- By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the Stellar Account Merge Quest and gain a deeper understanding of how to delete accounts on the Stellar network.

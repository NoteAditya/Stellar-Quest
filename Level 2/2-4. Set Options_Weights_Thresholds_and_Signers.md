## Additional Notes
- **Thresholds and Weights**: Always be careful setting thresholds and weights. If you set threshold values above 1 without adding more signers or increasing the master weight, you will lock yourself out of the account.
- **Signer Types**: For this quest, we are only configuring additional Stellar keys or Ed25519 Public Keys.

## Troubleshooting
- **Transaction Failed**: If the transaction fails, double-check your transaction details and ensure all fields are correctly filled. If you need help, visit the Stellar Discord And Stellar India Tg community for assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the Stellar Set Options - Weights, Thresholds, and Signers Quest and gain a deeper understanding of how to manage account settings and multisignature transactions on the Stellar network.
